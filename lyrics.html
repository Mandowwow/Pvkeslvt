I know
It's hard
To find
Why moan?

One more
Control
No pain

I've seen
White walls
Torn down
I know

You've grown
Your eyes
Your soul
Your hold

A happy car
A happy car
Needs no gas

I know
It's hard
To find
Oh no

It's hard to grow
It's hard to know

White walls are there
Fate unaware

Fate everywhere
It wasn't there

I know
Her eyes

See everywhere
See now it's there
See very clear
See how it goes

All that is left
Is hard
To find
Goodbye

Stay with me

It's how it starts
It's realised
It becomes your truth

You realise
You realign
Your solitude in

My fantasy
Who wouldn't be?
It breathes, it breaks down

You shouldn't be
My empathy
It becomes you

And now I'll learn all about
I will know all about you
Stupid fucking girl

And now I'll burn in your head
I won't be lonely
Stupid fucking girl

It's like a gift
You shouldn't give
You should not believe

The kind of lies
You'll realise
You owe a great debt

You shouldn't speak
You shouldn't grieve
It becomes your life

I'm like a priest
I like to preach
I become you

And now I'll learn all about
I will know all about you
Stupid fucking girl

And now I'll burn in your head
I won't be lonely
Stupid fucking girl

We feel, we need, we fight
We hurt, we seal it tight
We heal, we pray, we fuck
We weep, we rage, we love

I want your heart
I want your hand
I want your Ah~ Ah~ heart
I want your hand
Dance in my gun

We crawl, we scream, we're poor
We need, we kneel, we cure
We fail, we wail, I fall
You seek my arms at dawn
We crawl, decay, alive
We're dead, we're starved, denied

I want your heart
I want your hand
I want your Ah~ Ah~ heart
I want your hand
Dance in my gun

I crawl towards your love
We live, we die, we fuck

Fuck

Fuck

Love is just like this...

I want your heart
I want your hand
I want you hard
I want you bad

Everything is dead
Everything is dead
Everything is dead
Even you...

I will never die
Won't become like the others
I will never ever
Let you become like me

Build up an appetite for grey
No sun again, no sun today
Even in the deadly face of advice
Even in the deadly face of advice

Blue world comfort
Cold room just the same
I believe in lies
I believe in lies

Everything is dead
Everything is dead
Everything is dead
Even you...

You hate yourself

I will never die
Won't become like the others
I will never ever
Let you become like me

I will never die...

Distort dreams
Break my life
She felt a fool
A useless tool

All my words
Fallen down
On deaf ears
Voiceless tears

And I wanted to find the truth

I'm waiting for you
Voiceless

Distort dreams
Break my life
She felt a fool
A useless tool

You speak truth
You speak death
Always dead
All things said

She sees you
Father, fool
She needs you
Oh father, cruel

I wanted to be understood
I'm waiting for you
Voiceless

Beams descended on those adored
Summers breathless, your breath away
Thousand journeys towards this day

Now an eye looks me into mine
And these stories are intertwined
Now the pieces fall into place
And I hope that you dream of me
Ecstasy
A rhapsody
Throw yourself
Into me

In a twilight that shouldn't be
Even rain I've destroyed in me
Ocean calls, ocean corridor
Feel the breeze last when cold is warm

Now an eye looks me into mine
And these stories are intertwined

And this desire
Breathes into me

Get out of

Glow forever
Things must change

Get out of
Closing doors
Life a circle
Things must change

Get out of
Closing doors
Life uncertain
Things must change

Get out of

Glow forever
Things must change

I don't want
I don't need

And this desire
Breathes into me

And everything
Seems so real
Under these lights

If I could be the judge
I would judge it all as unjust
But beauty bears no grudge
Against me

The many different ways
To express the love of life
To remain aware of days
Against you

The words don't seem to make
Senseless drivel I spit worldwards
There are actions left to take
Against us

(Learn to float)

Get good at life
And learn to flow

To recall our past lives
Is to become a better place
And to hide away the knives
And feel good

To heal and clean the wound
A thousand stitches in my heart
To heal and clean the wound
And feel good

I've tried to tell the truth
But still have a lot of things to do
Yet all that's left for you
Is to feel... Aah

(Learn to float)

Get good at life
And learn to fly
Forever!
